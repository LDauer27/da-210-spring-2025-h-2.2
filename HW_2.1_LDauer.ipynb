    "1. These questions will _mostly_ focus on tabular data and Pandas, which will likely include new material, as well as some review and deepening of CS-11x.\n",
    "2. Don't forget to add your name above. You can edit the markdown by double-clicking on the cell. \n",
    "3. Save your work often and commit your changes using git/Github Desktop.\n",
    "4. When you are finished, save your work, convert the Jupytext Notebook to .html format, and submit the HTML file on Canvas.\n",
    "5. When you have completed homework 2.1 - 2.4, push your updated repo to Github.com.\n",
